# Various ML Algorithms

Main focus of this repo is to have implementation of various ML algoriths from scratch. It will be helpful for someone who wants not only wants to conceptually and intuitively understand various algos, but also learn how to code them. 
  
* [Basic Gradient Boosting algorithm from scratch](algo_scratch/gradient\ boosting\ from\ scratch.ipynb)

In this jupyter notebook, I have implementation of basic gradient boosting algorithm with an intuitive example. Learn about decision tree and intuition behind gradient boositng trees.
