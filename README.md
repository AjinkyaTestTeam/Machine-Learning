Machine-Learning

• Main focus of this repo is to have implementation of various ML algoriths from scratch. 
  It will be helpful for someone who wants to conceptually and intuitively understand various algos. 
  
• Notes for machine learning course (taught by Jeremy Howard) -- very very rough drafts. Prefer skipping.
